  <h1>Lead Connect - Our KPI's</h1>
  <p>What are the Key Performance Indicators that Vauxhall targets all retailers on?</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sales Margin - Vauxhall standard of 6% conversion</li>
    <li>Attempted Leads - Vauxhall minimum standard of 30% within an operational hour</li>
    <li>Contacted Leads - Must meet national average at a minimum</li>
    <li>Tenacity - Must meet national average at a minimum</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Lets Go Into More Detail</h4>
  <h5>Sales Margin</h5>
  <p>The Vauxhall standard of 6% at a minimum and aiming above 10% only applies to certian lead types, either Margin or Conversion Leads.</p>
  <p>Within these lead types only New vehicles marked as sold against these opportunities count towards the conversion score</p>
  <h5>Attempted Leads</h5>
  <p>The minimum stardard of 30% within an opperational hour applies to all leads that are assigned through the Lead Connect system, Margin, Conversion and Non-Margin Leads</p>
  <p>This is monitered by the use of the Trackback numbers</p>
  <h5>Contacted Leads</h5>
  <p>Again the minimum standard of meeting the national avergae applies to all leads that are assigned through the Lead Connect system</p>
  <p>Once again this is monitered by the use of Trackback numbers, and the end of call feedback options</p>
  <h5>Tenacity</h5>
  <p>Again the minimum standard of meeting the national avergae applies to all leads that are assinged through the Lead Connect system</p>
  <p>Again this is monitered by the use of the Trackback numbers, and the end of call feedback options</p>
  <h5>Using the Trackback numbers provided is Vitually important for reaching our KPI's - We should only not use them if the customer asks not to be called or if the number is incorrect</h5>
  <h4>KPI Monitering Time Scale</h4>
  <p>These KPI's are monitered on a quaterly basis. If the sales margin KPI is not met by the quater cut off point (Normally two months after the end of the quater, allowing for ongoing leads to reach termination) the the Margin will be lost biquaterly.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Q1 Sales Conversion Missed - Q3 Sales Margin Lost</li>
    <li>Q2 Sales Conversion Missed - Q4 Sales Margin Lost</li>
    <li>Q3 Sales Conversion Missed - Q1 Sales Margin Lost</li>
    <li>Q4 Sales Conversion Missed - Q2 Sales Margin Lost</li>
  </ul>
  <p>KPI results determine postion within the quaterly league, this is updated daily to reflect postions in real time.</p>
