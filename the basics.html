  <h1>Lead Connect Basics - Getting To Know Lead Connect</h1>
  <p>Once Logged into Lead Connect you will start on the Dashboard tab - this is your basecamp within lead connect.</p>

  <img src="http://i.imgur.com/K0rq3P0.png" alt="Dashboard">
  <p>Here you can see all New, Open, Closed and the Total Number of leads within the timeframe specified on the left hand side.</p>
  <p>To go further into the lead details simply click on the blue number in the relevant box for the lead type, There are various different lead types within lead connect.</P>
  <h4>The Main Lead Types You will Come Across</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>New Vehicle Sales</li>
    <li>Used Vehicle sales</li>
    <li>Finance-GMAC</li>
    <li>Motability</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Explore the different lead types in more detail <a href="lead types.html">Click Here!</a></p>
  <p>If you wanted to view all leads that are currently open click onto the Opportunities tab next to the dashboard tab, then on the drop down menu on the right hand side select the following option: 07 - Sales New and Open.</p>
  <p>The Dashboards time period on the left has four different options
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Last 7 Days</li>
        <li>Last 30 Days</li>
        <li>Last 180 Days</li>
        <li>Custom Date Range</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These can be changed to suit your needs</p>
      <p>Once you have clicked through to the opportunity type you are looking for, Lead Connect will display an overview of all these lead types i.e. New, New Vehicle Enquiries. Clicking the oportunity ID in blue will bring up a larger opportunities display
        with more information on the individual lead.</p>

      <img src="http://i.imgur.com/eyndH0u.png" alt="Larger Opportunity">
      <p>The box at the bottom of the opportunities column displays any extra information regarding the lead, quite often customer comments or questions are displayed here.</p>
      <p>To Contact a lead we must use the Trackback number provide, this will either be a Home, Work or Mobile number, these numbers can be found at the bottom of the Customer column</p>

      <h4>Using Trackback Numbers</h4>

      <img src="http://i.imgur.com/6beEcqT.png" alt="Track Back Number">
      <p>Trackback numbers are broken into two parts for example 013334147606-1234567</p>
      <p>The first part of the number 013334147606 we ring out like any other number to connect to the Trackback system, after this we use the second part of the number 1234567 and then enter # to start the call</p>
      <p>All calls made through the Trackback system are recorded</p>
      <p>When ending a call press the * button, this will then give us a number of options to record the outcome of the call onto the system i.e. Press 1 for no sales opportunity, Press 2 for further follow up etc.</p>
      <p>Once you have left an outcome you can hang up the call as normal</p>

      <h4>Lead Status</h4>

      <img src="http://i.imgur.com/BnIp1kX.png" alt="Lead Status">
      <p>The lead status; located on the right hand side of the larger opportunity display; automatically updates itself as the lead progresses from being Assigned to being Closed</p>
      <p>The indicators next to the times of the lead progression show a GREEN TICK if it has been achieved within the KPI time frame or a RED CROSS if it has not</p>
      <p>When you click onto a newly assigned lead it will automatically change from the status of Assigned to Accepted. This will then move the lead from the NEW column to the OPEN column on the dashboard. Because of this do not click into any leads without
        completing them as required or the lead could become lost within the already actioned leads</p>

      <h4>Other Lead Connect Functions</h4>
      <p>Lead Connect has a number of other functions that we can make use of to help us with an opportunity. If we look at the bottom left of the larger opportunity window you will see a tab saying More</p>

      <img src="http://i.imgur.com/PMNqRuP.png" alt="Lower Bar">
      <p>Clicking on this will bring up the following tabs that can be opened</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Activities</li>
        <li>Programs</li>
        <li>Contacts</li>
        <li>Finance</li>
        <li>Attachments</li>
        <li>Communication</li>
        <li>Service Appointments</li>
        <li>Linked Opportunities</li>
        <li>Contact Vehicle</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When completing a Finance opportunity the Finance tab is displayed automatically, this shows the customers Current Finance Agreement (including monthly payment), Contract Term, Outstanding Balance, and often Vauxhall will provide a suggest finance
        quote that is around the same monthly payments for the customer on a new vehicle.</p>

      <img src="http://i.imgur.com/KZteSTb.png" alt="Finance Tab">
      <p>Another tab that comes in use is the Communication tab, this displays all record communication with the customer - either through use of the Trackback number, or emails through Lead Connect. This is also what Vauxhall use to generate a dealer tenacity
        score (<a href="our KPI's.html">See Our KPI's</a>)</p>
      <p>This can be used to keep track of what times opportunities are called ensuring that you do not call them the same time every day.</p>
